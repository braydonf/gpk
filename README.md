# gpk

Git based, decentralized and secure package management for JavaScript and
Node.js libraries and applications.

## Features

- Packages are decentralized via Git and can be hosted and published
  via any Git repository.
- Signature verification via signed Git tags.
- Deterministic flat installation of packages to support commiting
  and bundling dependencies with Git.
- Resolves shared dependencies based on semantic versioning via Git
  tags (e.g. `v1.1.0`).
- Node.js C/C++ addon build support with `node-gyp`.
- Exclude files from a package with `.npmignore` and `.gitignore`.

## Install

Clone and verify:
```
git clone https://github.com/braydonf/gpk
cd gpk
git verify-commit HEAD
```

Install globally:
```
./bin/gpk install -g
```

## Usage

### Command examples

- `gpk install` Install dependencies and verify signatures.
- `gpk install https://<url>/<org>/<repo>` Install latest tag and add a dependency.
- `gpk install https://<url>/<org>/<repo>#<branch>` Install from a specific branch.
- `gpk install -g https://<url>/<org>/<repo>` Install a global module.
- `gpk install -g` Link a module globally.
- `gpk test` Run package tests.
- `gpk run <script>` Run package defined script.
- `gpk rebuild` Build native addons.
- `gpk uninstall <name>` Uninstall and remove a dependency.
- `gpk uninstall -g <name>` Uninstall a global module.
- `gpk init` Initialize a package.
- `gpk help` Display all available commands.

### Managing dependencies

Here is how to specify dependencies in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "bcoin": "git+https://github.com/bcoin-org/bcoin.git#semver:~2.0.0",
    "bcrypto": "git+https://github.com/bcoin-org/bcrypto.git#semver:~4.2.6",
    "bmultisig": "git+https://github.com/bcoin-org/bmultisig.git#semver:~2.0.0",
    "buffer-map": "git+https://github.com/chjj/buffer-map.git#semver:~0.0.7",
    "n64": "git+https://github.com/chjj/n64.git#semver:~0.2.10"
  }
}
```
The signature of the matching Git tag or commit is verified for each
dependency. The dependencies must be from a Git repository. The referenced
Git tag or commit must be signed and the necessary public keys imported.

You can also use `gpk` specific shorthand in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "remotes": {
    "bcoin-org": "git+https://github.com/bcoin-org/",
    "chjj": "git+https://github.com/chjj/"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "bcoin": "bcoin-org:bcoin.git#semver:~2.0.0",
    "bcrypto": "bcoin-org:bcrypto.git#semver:~4.2.6",
    "bmultisig": "bcoin-org:bmultisig.git#semver:~2.0.0",
    "buffer-map": "chjj:buffer-map.git#semver:~0.0.7",
    "n64": "chjj:n64.git#semver:~0.2.10"
  }
}
```

And specify Git branches:

```json
{
  "remotes": {
    "bcoin-org": "git+https://github.com/bcoin-org/",
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "bcoin": "bcoin-org:bcoin.git#pkg-dependencies",
  }
}
```

#### Upgrading dependencies

The behavior of `gpk` is that `gpk install` will not replace an existing
module, and will otherwise give an error if an existing installation does
not satisfy the current `package.json` specification.

To upgrade a dependency:

- Remove the dependency from `node_modules`.
- Run `gpk install` again to fetch an updated version.

To upgrade to a version greater than the current version
as specified by the semantic version in `package.json`, it's
necessary to update the `package.json` specification before
installing.

#### Commit dependencies

It is recommend to commit dependencies into the Git repository, this
provides the following benefits:
- Guarantee of availability of dependencies. It adds a mirror of the
  remote code, and thus a guarantee that the exact dependency is available
  regardless of network, third-party service, or module availability.
- Provides integrity of dependencies. This is functionally similar
  to `package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json` from npm-land. For
  committed dependencies to be used when the package is a dependency, the
  dependencies should be added to `bundleDependencies` in `package.json`.
- Removes the dependency upon a package manager for basic installation,
  as the dependencies are already available. Installation of `gpk` is
  only necessary for the management and upgrade of dependencies by
  contributors and maintainers.
- Compatibility with other package managers for building native addons.
  The use of `gpk rebuild`, `npm rebuild` or `yarn rebuild` can all
  be used.
- Efficiency of installation. It's not necessary to clone and verify
  each dependency, as they are already available. This is especially
  relevant when branches or specific commits are used instead of tagged
  releases of a dependency.

Note: You can use `git commit --author="<alternative-authors>"` when
commiting a large number of dependencies for purposes of commit statistics.

### Configuration

To customize the global installation path, use the
`PREFIX` environment variable, for example:

```sh
export PREFIX=/home/user/global_node_modules
```

And then add that to your path, for example:
```sh
export PATH="$PREFIX/bin:$PATH"
```

This may be necessary if the installation of Node.js
was via an operating system package manager or otherwise
installed at `/usr/bin` or another path that requires
root or admin permissions.

## Testing

Import the key used for signing:

```sh
gpg --recv-keys "5B7D C58D 90FE C1E9 90A3  10BA F24F 232D 108B 3AD4"
```

And run the tests:
```sh
gpk test
```

For detailed logging when running tests you can use
the environment variable `TEST_LOG`, for example:

```sh
TEST_LOG=true gpk test
```

Test data in created in a temporary directory, using
this format: `/tmp/gpk-test-<name>-<id>/`.
